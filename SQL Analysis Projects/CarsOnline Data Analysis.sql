# In this project I am using the CarsOnline Database.
# CarsOnline is a fictional online platform, allowing customers to find the 
# right car for them, buy it online, and get it right at their doorstep.

# The CarsOnline consists of the following tables:
# cars - Provides details about the various cars (both sold and unsold)
# car_types - Provides further details about the car type (i.e., Ford Mustang 1980)
# fuel_types - Provides further details about the car fuel type (i.e., Diesel, Electric etc.)
# transmission_types - Provides further details about the car gearbox type
# customers - Provides details about the companyâ€™s customers who have bought at least one car
# genders - Provides further details about the gender of each customer
# locations - Provides further details about the location of each customer
# sales - Provides details about each car purchase
